## Description
Embark on an immersive journey where you'll craft a captivating game experience where the player character deftly maneuvers left and right to catch cascading objects. This endeavor serves as a cornerstone for mastering object spawning, collision detection, and the art of score tracking. By the culmination of this project, you'll unveil a rudimentary catch-the-objects game primed for further augmentation with additional features and mechanics.

## Mechanics
- Object spawning
- Collision detection

## Systems Involved
- Random object spawn
- Player controller
- Collision detection
- Score counter

## Steps
1. Forge a new scene in the creative canvas.
2. Infuse vitality by introducing a player character (e.g., a cube) and a steadfast floor.
3. Craft a script to orchestrate the whimsical ballet of object spawning, whimsically adorning the sky at set intervals.
4. Pen a script to orchestrate the elegant pirouette of the player, gracefully swaying left and right to ensnare cascading objects.
5. Enrich the tapestry with collision detection, ensuring moments of euphoria as the player triumphantly captures objects mid-flight.
6. Enkindle the spirit of competition with a score counter, a beacon of achievement that ascends with each object gracefully caught.

## Existing Game Examples
